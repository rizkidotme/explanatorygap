Using the power of large language models to generate text, i have an idea to reverse-engineer my mind with the assumsion that giving a large enough dataset, the model will be able to generate a text that is similar to my thoughts. so the question is how to create a dataset to finetune LLM for this project? 

Turn out it is not that hard, i just need to write down my thoughts in a text file. so i started to write down my thoughts in a Microsoft OneNote, and i have been doing it for a 2 week, and i barely have 15k words. at this rate, it will take me almost 2 years to reach 500k words. so i need to find a way to speed up the process.

The first thing that came to my mind is to use a voice recorder to record my thoughts, but i don't think it will work, because i don't think i can speak out loud for all days, even i quite room, i still feel uncomfortable to speak out loud. 

I realized that i have a lot of thoughts when i am in the shower, but i know this is because when in bathroom my mind doesn't have to focus on anything, so i can just let my mind wander. so i think i need to find a way to let my mind wander when i am not in the bathroom. but, i realized that i can't just let my mind wander, because i will just think about random stuff, and i don't think it will be useful for this project. so i need to find a way to let my mind wander, but still focus on something.

I think i can do this by using a technique called "mindfulness meditation". the idea is to focus on my breath, and let my mind wander. the problems is i don't know how to do this, so i need to find a way to learn this technique. it just like dissect my own brain, and i don't know how to do that. 

final thought that come to my mind when to think about this is just write the damn thoughts down. i don't need to do anything fancy, just write down my thoughts. so i think i will just write down my thoughts in a text file, and i will just write down whatever that come to my mind. i don't need to focus on anything, and it feels really good to just write down whatever that come to my mind. so relaxing and fun.

but, the problems rise agains when i try to write down my thoughts. i realized that sometimes i just write the same ideas over and over again, maybe this will make the language model stress some idea that i repetitively write down. so i need to find a way to avoid this. or should i? maybe it is good to stress some idea, because it will make the model more likely to generate that idea.

but i want to discover the "other part" of me that i dont know yet. i tried manually instantiate a other people mind in my mind using computational thinking, i really hard and not realiable. 

## Instantiating a mind in my mind

the ideas goes like, given the assumsion that i am a complex system, and i have a lot of sub-systems, and i can control each sub-system, then i can create a sub-system that is a representation of other people mind. first i need to create a sub-system that is a representation of my mind, then i can create a sub-system that is a representation of other people mind. it like using docker on single monolithic system. 

given the four pillar of computational thinking that is: pattern recognition, abstraction, algorithm, and data structure, i can create a sub-system that is a representation of other people mind. or at very least an simulated version of other people mind that is good enough to be used as a friend that give me conterpoint to my ideas. 

the detail is worth another blog post so i will not go into detail here.

## at this point you may realize something

and guess what the large part of this writing is assisted by LLM model. i just write down whatever that come to my mind, and then LLM autocomplete the rest paragraph. i think this is help me ... WAIT 

## realization 

at this point i realise that LLm is not just a tool to generate text, but it is also a tool to help me write down my thoughts. i think the Microsoft OneNote is not best tool to do this jobs, i need an app that is more like a text editor, and i can just write down my thoughts, and then LLM will autocomplete the rest. 

## conclusion

Everybody is nobody. every thought is just a result of this algorithm that is running in my brain. i am just a complex system that is running this algorithm. this really algoritm is not me, it is just a tool that i use to simulate me. i dont need to identify with these thoughts, i can just let them go. when you realise you are not playing the game, but you are the character in the 3D hyperrealistic world that i called actual reality. 

## Nice to do 

if made this far to read this blog post, i think you need to give me some feedback to do this project better. please let me know.
