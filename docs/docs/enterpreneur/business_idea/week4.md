# Pitching, Testing and Prototyping

## Elevator Pitch

An elevator pitch is a short description of a business that can be given to people if there is not a lot of time to go into a full business plan description. The goal of an elevator pitch is to prompt the right question so that a conversation can be started that continues after the elevator ride is over. There are two methods of developing an elevator pitch: the high concept pitch and the two sentence pitch. The high concept pitch describes something by analogy, while the two sentence pitch states who the product is for, what it does, and why people would buy it over the competition. It is important to practice elevator pitches so that they are compelling and interesting.
