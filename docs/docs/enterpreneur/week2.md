### Opurtunities, uncertainty and enterpreneurship
How do i know i am in the right path?  there many things you to reduce uncertainty. overall in enterpreneurship there many things unknown risk and uncertainty than the conventional business. Conventioal business is more predictable. in enterpreneurial world there many things that you need to figure it out by yourself. the lean start up method is a good way to reduce uncertainty. 

Kaplanâ€“Meier estimator in business is a good way to estimate the probability of success.

$$\widehat{S}(t)=\prod_{i: t_i \leq t}\left(1-\frac{d_i}{n_i}\right)$$
where $t_i$ is the time of the $i$th event, $d_i$ is the number of deaths at time $t_i$, and $n_i$ is the number of subjects at risk at time $t_i$.

we can say that companies that change their core business from the initial business plan are more likely to succed than the companies that stick to the initial business plan. this is because the nature of the business is changing. the initial business plan is not the best business plan.

there many approach in ealy business. the lean start up method is a good way to reduce uncertainty. the business model canvas is also popular in early business. lastly the discovery driven planning is also a good way to reduce uncertainty. 

## push and pull strategy 

In order to create value in innovation three conditions have to hold. First, the need has to be real meaning that enough people have a deep enough need that solving that problem has economic value. So first the need has to be a real need. Second, your solution actually has to meet the need. It has to address the challenge, make the pain go away for the customer. And a third condition is that the customer has to be willing to pay you more for the solution than it costs you to deliver it. And if you as the entrepreneur can achieve all three of these conditions, then you can typically create value through innovation. 

there are two ways to create value in innovation. the first one is push strategy. the push strategy is a strategy where you try to push your product to the market. the second one is pull strategy. the pull strategy is a strategy where you try to pull the market to your product.

at pull stratgy you Start with a need, explore lots of solutions, pick the solution that best meets the need at an attractive cost

at push strategy you Start with a solution, explore lots of needs, pick the need that best fits the solution at an attractive cost. it like reverse engineering the market. 

### another flavor of push strategy
when technologies so advance that it can be used to solve many problems. the push strategy is a good way to create value. 

## importance of idea (VIDE model)

the idea is really important but the teams you can come up with a lot of creative idea. 
$$ value = f (I, D, E) $$
where I stand for idea, D stand for devepment and E stand for exagenous factor. 

Well how do we actually measure the quality of the raw idea? What we did was to take a large sample of consumers, show them a concept description of the original idea, and use a simple purchase intent survey which asked them to select one of five options from, I would definitely not buy to I definitely would buy. This is called a five box purchase intent survey. And it's one of the standard techniques in market research for assessing the quality of an idea, and the eventual sales of a new product.

What we found was quite interesting. The first thing that we found was that experts are actually not so good at predicting success. **We found that four random consumers, just randomly selected consumers, actually provide a better estimate of idea quality than seven experts**. That is consumers themselves are the best single indicator of the quality of an idea and is the best single predictor of whether the product will sell or not. And that in fact, four consumers provide a better estimate than even a larger number of experts, than even seven experts.

## accessing oportunities 

## the tournament apporach

The ugly truth of entrepreneurship is that any single opportunity is plagued by uncertainty. Is the need real? Will my solution work? What will my competitors do? What's going to happen in the macro economy? Will our team be able to execute? Will our partners deliver? What happens to the regulatory environment? There's really nothing you can do to eliminate all uncertainty.
