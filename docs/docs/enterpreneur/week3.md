# Market, need-filling and planning. 

## Defining the Focal Market.

The s-curve is a well-proven piece of social science that tells you about how people adopt new technologies over time. Startups need to be very focused in their market because they don't have the resources to explore lots of alternatives. The s-curve can help you figure out which market segment to go after as a startup. You want to think about whether your beachhead customer is a good reference, valuable for learning, or coherent with the rest of your strategy. The s-curve also suggests strategy for entering a market depending on where along the s-curve your customers are.

here a picture of the s-curve.

you need to be aware of the s-curve when you are doing your market research. a lot of people is not ealy adopter. a lot of people is not early majority. you need to be aware of this when you are doing your market research.

## Market segmentation

Market segmentation is the process of dividing a market into distinct groups of buyers who have different needs, characteristics, or behaviors and who might require separate products or marketing programs. Market segmentation is a marketing concept which divides the complete market of a business into smaller groups of consumers on the basis of some common characteristics. 

## Market positioning

 Market positioning is the process of designing a company's product or service offering and image to occupy a distinctive place in the target customer's mind. Market positioning is the process of designing a company's product or service offering and image to occupy a distinctive place in the target customer's mind. 

### Market size

Market size is an important factor when you are doing market research. the market size is the total number of people that you can sell your product to. if you are doing business to business you need to be aware of the market size. if you are doing business to consumer you need to be aware of the market size. 

### Market growth

Market growth is also an important factor when you are doing market research. the market growth is the rate of growth of the market. if the market is growing fast you need to be aware of this. 

### Market share

Market share is also an important factor when you are developing your business plan. the market share is the percentage of the market that you are going to take. at early blue ocean where there is no competition you can take a lot of market share, it hard to identifies the blue ocean, because there are no market research about it. you need to do research own your own.

## Understanding User Needs

And in fact, it is almost natural for an entrepreneur or an engineer to go build a product based on a hypothesis that you have. It all makes sense in our head. But the question is whether the user actually values the product that you have in mind. Without user research, the chances of failure can be high simply because you might build something that isn't a real important pain point for the user. Or maybe it's the right pain point but you build it the wrong way, or perhaps you end up with two many iterations before you arrive at product market fit and therefore you end up losing time.

### Four step of need identifications 

1. Gather raw data from customers

The question is what kind methodology you use to gather the data. You can use surveys, you can use interviews, you can use focus groups, you can use ethnographic studies, you can use diary studies, you can use usability studies, you can use a lot of different methodologies. The key is to make sure that you are getting the right data from the right people. 

it also worth to mention that when gathering data from customers using interview method, who and how many is the questions that you need to ask yourself. In terms of who to interview, it's important to interview all the relevant stakeholders. That includes the eventual user, but it also includes the buyer of the product to the extent that the buyer is not the eventual user. It includes advisors who advise either the buyer or the user in their choices. What is really important to keep in mind as you determine who to interview is that one should not assume the customer segment of interest. don't making too big an assumption too early and so it's important that your sample be sufficiently varied. 

early stage of enterpreneurship dont need necessarily a lot of data. you can do a lot of research with a small sample size. you dont even need fancy statistical method to do your research, banal qualitative method is enough. for starter, 8 - 25 is a good sample size. 

**best practice during interview** 
- forget the concept of product you have in mind and focus on user need. 
- no Leading question.
- ask about the current state rather than speculating about the future state.
- ask for spesific need rather than general need.
