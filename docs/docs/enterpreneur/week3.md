# Market, need-filling and planning. 

## Defining the Focal Market
The s-curve is a well-proven piece of social science that tells you about how people adopt new technologies over time. Startups need to be very focused in their market because they don't have the resources to explore lots of alternatives. The s-curve can help you figure out which market segment to go after as a startup. You want to think about whether your beachhead customer is a good reference, valuable for learning, or coherent with the rest of your strategy. The s-curve also suggests strategy for entering a market depending on where along the s-curve your customers are.
